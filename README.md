# 3D Perception - Target Identification & Pick-and-Place

##### In this project, I solved a perception problem in order to locate and identify the target objects from a collection of other objects in a cluttered environment using `PCL` and an `SVM` model. Below are more details:
1. Used Point Cloud filtering and `RANSAC` plane fitting to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the scene.
2. Applied `PCL's` Euclidean Clustering algorithm to create separate clusters for individual items.
3. Extracted features and trained an `SVM` model on new objects with a result of the accuracy of `91%` on average.
4. Applied pick and place function (using `PR2` virtual robot) and achieved `95.8%` accuracy on three different environment.

##### Code reference

The core code is generated inside `capture_features.py`, `object_recognition.py` and `train_svm.py` under `\scripts` folder.

##### Results reference

There is a report under `\documents` for more details about what I did and the results generated by my method.
